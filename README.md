## 🚀 Projects & Deployments

### 🔹 Heart Disease Prediction App
I built and deployed a Machine Learning model having 94% accuracy, that predicts the chance of heart disease using 14 input features.  


i have used render's free web service platform to deploy this model, which is live for only 15 minutes. It is possible that link provided below of demo may not work.
